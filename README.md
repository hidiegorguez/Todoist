# Todoist Automation with Python

## Workflow

1. Create your branch from Pro.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Install the libraries or create your environment based on requirements.txt.
4. Select your environment features in 'src/.env': your Todoist API token (TODOIST_API_TOKEN) and your Outlook mail and password (MAIL, PASSWORD).
5. Create your notebook. You can base it on ours (maindiego.ipynb, maintoni.ipynb).
6. Start trying some automation (feel free to add new functions to our functions.py).
7. main.py can be used as well, but its main focus is to run it with an Azure Timer Trigger Function (0 0 3 * * *).

## Reminder

Clear your notebook outputs before pushing, it may contain confidential info.
