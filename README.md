1. Create your branch from Pro.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Install the libraries or create your enviroment based on requirements.txt.
4. Select your enviorment features in 'src/.env': your Todoist API token (TODOIST_API_TOKEN) and your Outlook mail and password (MAIL, PASSWORD).
5. Create your notebook. You can based it on ours (maindiego.ipynb, maintoni.ipynb).
